Do not create workarounds or fallbacks. If something doesn't work it should error out and have robust error logging so that if something does fail then we know exactly what failed and how to fix it. Do not use mock data in tests, use the real data and test to ensure everything is working and functioning as it should. Do not cover up something not working correctly by making a test that passes when the project is in a broken state.

Make sure you always check subagents work personally yourself and don't rely on their responses to be correct without verifying/validating what they've done yourself. /home/smash/Documents/dev-env/Playground/ruv/crechebooks/specs/constitution.md /home/smash/Documents/dev-env/Playground/ruv/crechebooks/claudeflow.md read these document and figure out how to optimally use of claude flow to complete the objectives. RUN ALL SUBAGENTS SYNChronously. ENSURE CORRECT ORDER of agent launch, don't launch an agent if it needs another agents output to accomplish its mission. ultra think. You MUST read all of the documents I listed. ABSOLUTELY NO BACKWARDS COMPATIBILITY. the system needs to work after changes or fail fast so it can be debugged.

you need to use subagents and optimally use the claude flow system and memories to coordinate all of the agents doing this in a way that they are all working together, sharing memories and knowing which memories to access so you can use 10 agents but with memories they can all act as 1. spawn them synchronously. MAKE SURE ALL SUBAGENTS ARE TELLING YOU WHAT MEMORIES THEY LEFT SO YOU KNOW WHERE TO TELL THE NEXT SUBAGENT YOU CREATE TO LOOK FOR MEMORIES ENSURE CORRECT ORDER of agent launch, don't launch an agent if it needs another agents output to accomplish its mission. ultra think. You MUST read all of the documents I listed.

/home/smash/Documents/dev-env/Playground/ruv/crechebooks/pushrepo.md when pushing the repo ensure that all requirements in /home/smash/Documents/dev-env/Playground/ruv/crechebooks/specs/tasks/TASK-PAY-001  are met. if they are not met in any shape or form you need to throw up a red flag and warn me and tell me what the issue is.

/home/smash/Documents/dev-env/Playground/ruv/crechebooks/specs/constitution.md MUST read AND OBEY this file. Make sure to run linters. IMPORTANT You MUST READ EVERYTHING I TOLD YOU TO READ AND ONCE YOU'VE DONE THAT THEN YOU SELECT THE OPTIMAL REASONING MODE(S). Also ensure you are prompting subagents to also understand the problem then figure out the most optimal reasoning methods to use to solve it.

/home/smash/Documents/dev-env/Playground/ruv/crechebooks/specs/tasks/TASK-SARS-001 and update it with any information it needs to best be able to accomplish the task based off what you've learned so that it is better aware of the current state of the project. Include anything you've learned that you think would be helpful to an ai agent coding assistant that knows nothing about what has happened and doesn't know anything about the project so that they can look at this and perfectly implement it. to do this you must ensure there is no ambiguity in the task document. Audit this task against the current codebase. Identify any discrepancies, particularly regarding file paths, names, or structures that have changed. Update this task to ensure all references align with the project's actual current state. Also you can review git history to get a better idea of what has happened recently.

This is going to be a task read by an AI agent with a fresh context window and I want it to get full contextual understanding of everything it needs to do while keeping the token count as low as possible without loosing any context.
