/home/smash/Documents/dev-env/Playground/chris-royse/UsefulPrompts/crechebooks-specs/specs/tasks/TASK-CORE-002.md update this with any information it needs to best be able to accomplish the task based off what you've learned so that it is better aware of the current state of the project. Include anything you've learned that you think would be helpful to an ai agent coding assistant that knows nothing about what has happened and doesn't know anything about the project so that they can look at this and perfectly implement it. to do this you must make sure there is no ambiguity in the task document. Audit this task against the current codebase. Identify any discrepancies, particularly regarding file paths, names, or structures that have changed. Update this task to ensure all references align with the project's actual current state. Also you can review git history to get a better idea of what has happened recently. ABSOLUTELY NO BACKWARDS COMPATIBILITY. The system needs to work after changes or fail fast so it can be debugged. Do not create workarounds or fallbacks. If something doesn't work it should error out and have robust error logging so that if something does fail then we know exactly what failed and how to fix it. Do not use mock data in tests, use the real data and test to ensure everything is working and functioning as it should. Do not cover up something not working correctly by making a test that passes when the project is in a broken state. /home/smash/Documents/dev-env/Playground/chris-royse/UsefulPrompts/crechebooks-specs/specs/constitution.md MUST read this file. This is going to be a task read by an AI agent with a fresh context window and I want it to get full contextual understanding of everything it needs to do while keeping the token count as low as possible without loosing any context. IMPORTANT You MUST READ EVERYTHING I TOLD YOU TO READ AND ONCE YOU'VE DONE THAT THEN YOU SELECT THE OPTIMAL REASONING MODE(S)

look at /home/smash/Documents/dev-env/Playground/chris-royse/UsefulPrompts/crechebooks-specs/specs/tasks/TASK-CORE-003.md so you have an idea of what will be happening after this task.
